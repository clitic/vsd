# Alternatives

List of alternatives to vsd:

1. [N_m3u8DL-RE](https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-RE) is the best alternative to vsd. It also supports live playlists, which vsd does not. However, it lacks features like *capture* functionality.
2. [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is excellent for downloading various playlists, but its main drawback is limited support for decryption.
3. [dash-mpd-cli](https://github.com/emarsden/dash-mpd-cli) is a highly effective tool for downloading DASH playlists. In fact, much of vsd’s internal logic for parsing and downloading DASH content is based on this tool.
4. [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) supports direct encoding of playlists.
5. Both [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) and [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc) allow direct streaming of playlists.
